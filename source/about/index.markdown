## Who are we?

Fredericton Computerists is a community for programmers of all stripes to get
together, share their experiences, teach, and learn.

We aim to have programmers from a wide rage of backgrounds experience tell
stories about the things they've learned, the projects they've uddertaken,
the problems they solve.

## Our Principles

### Inclusivity

Computing is a vast field and the people who work within it are diverse in their
backgrounds and viewpoints. We're artists and academics, professionals and dabblers,
teachers and learners, novices and experts. We believe that in order to learn from
each other, we need to provide a productive space for that learning. To this end,
we observe the Recurse Center's [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).

### Storytelling

We've seen a lot of technical talks and presentations, and we believe a few things
about a good talk:

#### A good talk is a *story*, not a *sales pitch*

Everyone gets excited about the tools and techniques they use to program. Excitement
is great! What we really love is people's experience working with things. If you switched
from X to Y, why did you decide to do that? What challenges did you have? Were
they addressed?

#### There are infinite ways to tell a story

Let's face it, Fredericton is a small town. We only have so many people working with
so many technologies to solve so many problems. We can only give so many talks about
MVC frameworks or programming languages or databases. But stories? We've got loads
of those. Like that time you saw a problem in your community and tried to solve it.
Or that production outage at work that turned your stomach. Or the thing you learned
that changed how you think about how you work or play?
